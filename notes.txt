Components and JSX Review

- Components are the core building block of React Apps
- React is the library that allows us to create Components

- React app can described as componenet tree, with one root and infinit nested child

- Each componenets render/return some JSX code - which renders HTML to the DOM
- JSX is not HTML but looks like it (className is class in HTML)
- Its allow to write like HTML so it easier instead of using nested React.createElement()

- When Handling Components you can do as function or as Class

Props & States Review

- Changes done on props and react will lead React to rerender componenets and update the DOM

- props: Allows to pass data from a parent to a child element ex: 
    <Component dataX="X" dataY="Y"> Some Text </Component> the data is accessed with {} or props.children

- state: Allows to manipulate the data in the class providing more dinamic approach. Only class-based 
    components can define and use state.

- Its possible just like any other OOP language to add methods in the Class which can be called on events Handling
    like onClick=method, however it is important to remember that to change a property in state you need to use
    setState(pass the property that will be overwritten)

Note:
    - Every thing in React is JavaScript so you can output JSX based on conditions
    - You can use variables that hold JSX (HTML Style) and display it
    - You can handle list by Maping it and take advantage of the index
    - Use key so React can update efficiently in the DOM
