Components and JSX Review

- Components are the core building block of React Apps
- React is the library that allows us to create Components

- React app can described as componenet tree, with one root and infinet nested child

- Each componenets render/return some JSX code - which renders HTML to the DOM
- JSX is not HTML but looks like it (className is class in HTML)
- Its allow to write like HTML so it easier instead of using nested React.createElement()

- When Handling Components you can do as function or as Class

Props & States Review

- Changes done on props and react will lead React to rerender componenets and update the DOM

- props: Allows to pass data from a parent to a child element ex: 
    <Component dataX="X" dataY="Y"> Some Text </Component> the data is accessed with {} or props.children

- state: Allows to manipulate the data in the class providing more dinamic approach. Only class-based 
    components can define and use state.
